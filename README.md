# DashCam

DashCam is a custom made dash-cam that in addition to recording, it recognizes the owner and takes pictures of unrecognized faces. I believe that 
the face recognition is important because according to the 2020 CHP titled "2020 California Vehicle Theft Facts", "Of the 180,939 vehicles stolen
statewide in 2020, 89.2 percent were successfully recovered, representing 161,464 recovered vehicles". Given that statistic, DashCam can aid in 
helping authorities track down thieves.
